# FlexCar App


# Assumptions
Please note that following assumptions were taken into account before starting the project:-

1. The location zip code is required to access the  https://www.flexcar.com/inventory, but was not provided in the document, so I have searched and found that Flexcar is operational in Atlanta, so will be using that location.

2. No assets have been provided (such as images of cars / icons/ fonts etc), in this case I will try to mimic page as close to https://www.flexcar.com/inventory/atlanta as possible.

3. There is no backend endpoint provided to fetch the data from, in this case I will model the data on frontend entirely.
